# MA Heatmap Visualization
### A d3 heatmap vizualization of annual income by census tract in Massachusetts

Contents of the repo include a topojson file expressing the boundaries of all the census tracts in the state of MA.  I used the census API to pull down household income by tract from the 2010 census data.  I then used D3 to generate a heat-map visualization of the state showing income by tract.
